# Order Execution System - Privateer Capital

## Overview

This document details the enhanced order execution system implemented to ensure reliable order placement and execution, particularly in challenging market conditions. The system uses a progressive fallback approach with multiple redundancy layers.

## Key Features

### 1. Progressive Fallback Order Execution

The order execution system implements a multi-tiered approach to ensure reliable trade execution:

- **First Attempt (IOC + 0.5% slippage)**: Initial order uses Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) orders with modest 0.5% slippage
- **Second Attempt (IOC + 2.0% slippage)**: If the first attempt fails, retry with 2.0% slippage
- **Final Attempt (GTC + 5.0% slippage)**: If all IOC attempts fail, switch to Good-Till-Cancel (GTC) orders with 5.0% slippage

This progressive approach ensures that:
- Most orders execute instantly with tight slippage (first attempt)
- Orders that fail due to liquidity issues still execute with acceptable slippage (second attempt)
- Orders that can't immediately match still get placed as persistent GTC orders (final attempt)

### 2. Rate Limiting Protection

The system implements strict rate limiting to prevent API rate limit violations:
- Maximum 30 requests per minute
- Minimum 200ms interval between consecutive requests
- Request timestamps tracked in sliding window
- Automatic delays when approaching rate limits

### 3. Network Error Handling

Enhanced error handling for Hyperliquid API calls:
- 15-second timeout for all operations
- Detection of network errors (ETIMEDOUT, ECONNRESET)
- Detailed error logging with context
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### 4. Position Closure Logic

Special consideration is given to position closure, which has more aggressive fallback parameters:

- **First Attempt (IOC + 2.0% slippage)**: Uses a more aggressive initial slippage for closing
- **Emergency Attempt (IOC + 10% slippage)**: If the first attempt fails, uses substantially higher slippage
- **Final Attempt (GTC + 15% slippage)**: Guaranteed position closure with GTC orders and very high slippage

This approach prioritizes successfully closing positions even in extreme market conditions.

### 5. Database-Exchange Synchronization

A robust synchronization system has been implemented to ensure consistency between database records and actual exchange positions:

- **Automatic Synchronization**: Runs every 5 minutes via Cloud Scheduler
- **Manual Synchronization**: Available through dedicated endpoint
- **Inconsistency Detection**: Identifies and logs mismatches between recorded and actual positions
- **Automated Recovery**: Takes appropriate actions to reconcile database with exchange state

This prevents trading errors caused by the database falling out of sync with the exchange.

### 6. Order Verification 

The system implements rigorous verification of order status:

- **Execution Verification**: Confirms positions are actually opened/closed after orders are placed
- **Size Verification**: Validates that executed size matches requested size
- **Price Verification**: Records actual execution price for analysis
- **Error Logging**: Detailed logging of all order failures with recovery attempts

## Endpoints and Scheduled Jobs

### New Synchronization Endpoint

- `/sync/sync-positions`: Reconciles database positions with exchange positions

### New Scheduled Job

- **Position Synchronization**: Runs every 5 minutes, invoking the sync-positions endpoint

## Safeguards

The system includes multiple safeguards to ensure trade integrity:

1. **Rate Limiting Protection**: Prevents API rate limit violations
2. **Exchange Network Retries**: Automatic retry with backoff for network-related failures
3. **Order Timeout Handling**: Graceful handling of orders that don't receive timely responses
4. **SDK Connection Management**: Ensures SDK connection is valid before each operation

## Implementation Details

The order execution enhancements are primarily implemented in `hyperliquidExecutor.ts` through:

- Fixed slippage tiers with progressive fallback strategy
- Execution verification with detailed error reporting
- Helper methods for consistent order handling

The synchronization system is implemented via:
- `synchronizePositions.ts` script for manual synchronization
- `sync.ts` router that exposes the synchronization API endpoint
- Cloud Scheduler job running every 5 minutes
